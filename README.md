# AI_Educational_Chatbot

🔹 Project Overview
This project is an AI-driven financial education chatbot designed to teach users personal finance, investing, and banking concepts through interactive conversations. The chatbot dynamically adjusts its responses based on the user's knowledge level, ensuring personalized learning experiences for both beginners and advanced learners.

🛠️ Key Features
✅ Conversational AI for Financial Education

Users engage in a structured conversation where they answer finance-related questions.
The chatbot provides real-time feedback, explanations, and follow-up questions.
✅ Personalized Learning Paths

Beginner learners receive basic financial literacy questions (e.g., "What is compound interest?").
Advanced learners (e.g., Student2) get deeper, real-world financial applications (e.g., "How does inflation impact investments?").
✅ Keyword-Based Understanding Assessment

The chatbot tracks the keywords in user responses to evaluate their understanding.
If a user struggles, the chatbot provides hints, examples, and fill-in-the-blank exercises.
✅ Dynamic Prompt Engineering for AI Responses

Uses structured prompts to ensure accurate, topic-specific responses.
AI generates clear, structured financial explanations with key takeaways.
✅ Follow-Up Questioning for Deeper Learning

The chatbot doesn’t just answer questions—it challenges users to think critically.
If a user demonstrates understanding, the chatbot asks advanced follow-up questions before moving on.
✅ Session-Based Tracking

Saves user progress by tracking which financial topics have been covered.
Users cannot move to the next question until they demonstrate understanding.
✅ Interactive & Engaging Learning Experience

Uses structured formatting (bullet points, key term highlights, and examples).
Encourages active participation through question-based learning.
